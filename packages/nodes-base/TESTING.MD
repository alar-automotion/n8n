To write unit tests it is suggested to use AI for 
help.

## Approach

1. **Create the test file**: Decide which node you want to test and create a test file with the corresponding name in the test folder. For example, for a node in `nodeA/v2/NodeAV2.ts`, create a test file in `nodeA/v2/test/NodeAV2.test.ts`.

2. **Use AI assistance**: Send this prompt to your AI tool (Cursor, Copilot, Claude, etc.):
   ```
   Using guidelines in @TESTING_PROMPT.md, write tests for @NodeAV2.node.ts in @NodeAV2.node.test.ts
   ```
   Make sure file names after `@` are detected and referenced by your tool.
   You can improve the prompt by asking to cover specific test cases.

3. **Review and refine**: Thoroughly review the generated tests, make necessary fixes, and remove redundant tests. 

[!NOTE]
Even if generated by AI, it's still your responsibility to ensure tests are working and reasonable.
